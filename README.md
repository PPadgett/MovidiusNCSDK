# MovidiusNCSDK

Chef Recipe to configure Ubuntu system with Movidius NCSDK API/Tools.  Also added unit testing help verify everything is working before you start refining your model. 


Note:  Currently Test Kitchen does not support usbfiltering (that I can find) in the Yaml file.  So a quick reboot of the VM system is required before the (hello_ncs_py) script will work.
